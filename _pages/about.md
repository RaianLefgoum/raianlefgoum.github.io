Welcome to my webpage!

I'm a third-year PhD student in Applied mathematics and Stochastic optimization at CERMICS, Ecole des Ponts under the supervision of <a href="http://cermics.enpc.fr/~jpc/">
Jean-Philippe Chancelier </a>. The topic of my thesis is the multistage stochastic optimization of hydrogen supply chains.

Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained an engineering degree in computer science from École Nationale Supérieure d’Informatique, Algiers (2020), followed by a Master’s degree (Master 2) in Applied Mathematics from Paris Dauphine-PSL (2021).
